            <dt>What is this site for?</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>This site is solely designed to allow you to easily share markdown text.</p>
              <p><a href="/create/">Paste in your markdown</a>, then share the resulting link with your friends, colleagues, or other people.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>How secret is my uploaded text?</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Although the URLs which are generated are "random" that is the only security present.  If a remote user finds a link to your text they can view it, or download it.</p>
              <p><b>NOTE</b>: There is no intention of ever password-protecting the uploaded contents.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>How is this site built?</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>The site is written with a small number of Perl libraries, and you can <a href="https://github.com/skx/markdown.share/">study the source code</a> if you wish.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Can I run my own install?</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Yes you can, the previous question contained a link to the source code which powers this site, and you may also download a <tt>docker</tt> container containing a running copy of the code.</p>
              <p>The docker container can be found <a href="https://index.docker.io/u/skxskx/markdown.share/">here in the docker index</a>.</p>
