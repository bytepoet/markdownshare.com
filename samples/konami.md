# Bonus Feature : Emojis

If you've found this page you should know that emojis are available in the markdown output.  Simply use `:name:` and this will be replaced with the appropriate image.

The name must be a valid emojis term, as unrecognized names will be rendered unchanged.  Valid names include the obvious:

| Emokis Name | Rendered Image |
|:-----------:|:--------------:|
|`angel`      | :angel:        |
|`apple`      | :apple:        |
|`bike`       | :bike:         |
|`boy`        | :boy:          |
|`cake`       | :cake:         |
|`cat`        | :cat:          |
|`dog`        | :dog:          |
|`girl`       | :girl:         |
|`kiss`       | :kiss:         |
|`older_man`  | :older_man:    |
|`older_woman`| :older_woman:  |
|`penguin`    | :penguin:      |
|`smile`      | :smile:        |
|`unknown`    | :unknown:      |



## About This Page

This page is present to prove that I, [Steve Kemp](http://steve.org.uk/),
developed, wrote, and deployed this project.

Unfortunately some people will insist that their installations of my
projects are official and _home-made_ despite that not being the case.
